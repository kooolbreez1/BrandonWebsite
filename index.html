                   My name is Brandon and I am a software engineer. I graduated from Beloit
                   College on May 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Psychology. I have experience working with
                   Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, PSQL and many other languages both alone
                   and in groups using paired programming and AGILE methodologies. I am always trying to learn new techniques
                   and programming languages.

        <dl id="faqText">
            <dt>What motivates you at work?</dt>
            <dd>I love taking on new challenges. each new project is like a puzzle that is waiting to be solved.</dd>
            <dt>What does your preferred supervisor to employee relationship look like? </dt>
            <dd>I like supervisors who make their expectations clear and are easy to communicate with. I like supervisors
                that push me to achieve more and offer resources to help me if i get stuck.</dd>
            <dt>What are a few things that are most important to you in your work?</dt>
            <dd>Things that are important to me are that I am making a real contribution to the team, that I am working
                on something useful and that I am learning new techniques and skills in the process.</dd>
            <dt>What do you think are some of the most pressing issues in the field?</dt>
            <dd>This is a tough question because there are a large number of issues that we are currently facing. The first
                 issue that comes to mind is data collection and what we do with that data. going off of this the next issue that comes to
            mind is security. Once we collect data how do we protect it? With the recent data breaches at prominent companies (like Equifax)
             the security of any data collected is of paramount importance. In order to minimize the dangers of data being stolen we
             should only collect data that is necessary and make securing that data a top priority. We must also ensure that users are aware of
             what data we collect and how its used.</dd>
            <dt>When you run into problems how do you deal with them?</dt>
            <dd>The first thing I do is run a quick google search of the problem to see if anyone else has run into it before and solved it.
             If this doesn't work I check to see if any of my team members have run into similar issues and how they solved them. If
            my team has never encountered the problem before I step through the code to figure out exactly where it breaks which usually
             sheds light on what exactly the issue is and how to go about fixing it.</dd>
            <dt>What experience do you have in the field?</dt>
            <dd>I have been programming since my freshmen year of college. I have worked on a large number of projects both individually
            and in groups utilizing many different languages. The project that I am most proud of is the <a href="https://github.com/beloitcollegecomputerscience/OED">Open Energy Dashboard</a>
            which is an open source project that collects and stores energy use data from the meters spread across the Beloit College campus
            and displays the data in easy to understand graphs. For this project my class worked in small teams to create the dashboard which helped me understand how to
            work within a group and across groups in an AGILE environment.</dd>
            <dt>What is an example of a time that you were allowed to be creative in your work. What was exciting and difficult about it?</dt>
            <dd>This website is one example of a time that I had complete creative freedom. I find working on this website to be exciting because
            its my space and I can put anything I want on it. The most difficult aspect of creating this website so far has been designing the overall layout.
             When I started working on it I realized just how important overall design is and that knowing how I want to design the website would make coding it
            significantly easier. Its easy to create a basic webpage but I want this website to have some sense of style.</dd>
            <dt>Tell me about a time you failed and how you dealt with the situation.</dt>
            <dd>Everyone fails sometimes, its a part of the learning process. On one of my first group projects my team and I had a large number
            of goals that we had set out to accomplish by the end of the semester. We made a timeline for when we wanted to accomplish
             these goals and we started working. It was only after we started programming that we realized that the things that we thought were simple
             were actually much more complicated than we originally planned. This caused us to go over our expected time and we were not able to
             accomplish everything that we set out to do in the amount of time we gave ourselves. I learned to always expect to run into problems and to give
            myself more time to deal with them. I also learned that even seemingly simple tasks can quickly become more complicated than they seem.</dd>
            <dt>How do you keep yourself organized when working on a long term project?</dt>
            <dd>I like to have a list of goals which I mark as TODO's. I keep track of which goals are currently being worked on, which ones have been
            completed and which ones have yet to be started. I keep this list as a file in the project and update it as I think of new goals, start working on something
             or complete a goal. If I decide that there are many steps to complete a goal I keep track of each step along the way in a similar manner.</dd>
            <dt>How do you ensure that the software you are working on meets the stakeholders expectations?</dt>
            <dd>In order to ensure that all stakeholders are happy with the project I am constantly communicating with them.
            I keep them up to date on my progress and I show them demos of how the software works as I build it. I am constantly
            Asking for their feedback and I incorporate it into the project.</dd>
            <dt>Describe a time you were the primary expert. How did you ensure that everyone understood you?</dt>
            <dd>When I am the primary expert I explain things to my team using examples from the current project. I also make sure that
            my team can ask me questions as they are working whenever they run into an issue and I try to resolve it with them. This was the case
             when working on the Open Energy Dashboard. Members of my group had trouble setting up the project and getting it to
            run on their computers. They had run into an issue that I had already solved so I walked them through the steps to resolve the issue.
             I watched them as they worked to make sure they were following my instructions and I made clear to them that they could ask for my help
             at any time.</dd>
